This document reports a simple experiment using Google Consumer Surveys. 

```{r silent_parms, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# libraries needed
library(quantmod) # read FRED
library(gdata) # read Excel
options("getSymbols.warning4.0"=FALSE)
Sys.info()
```

```{r parms}
# define basic parameters
price_quoted <- 3
price_minimum <- 0.1
budget <- 500
coupon <- 75
result_file <- c("Employment and search.xls")

```
Survey instrument
-----------------
We based our survey instrument on the primary labor force question on the CPS, somewhat modified:

![question 1](Selection_043.png)

We followed up for all non-employed (all those not responding with "Yes"") with a question on search intensity that was not based on the CPS:

![question 1](Selection_044.png)

Results
-------
Google first ran a test (which resulted in being 4 responses) to assess how much to charge us. Google claims that prices are between $`r price_minimum` and $`r price_quoted`. In our case, the quoted price was $`r price_quoted` per response, and our budget was $`r budget` (although we were offered a one-time coupon valued at $`r coupon`. We thus requested  `r floor((budget + coupon)/price_quoted)` cases. Once accepted, Google posted the survey, targetting the "general population in the United States on the Google Consumer Survey publisher network". 

```{r read_xls}
# get overview data
xls_overview <- read.xls(result_file,sheet=1)
xls_topline <- read.xls(result_file,sheet=2)
xls_data <- read.xls(result_file,sheet=3)
```
To our initial surprise, we had received `r xls_overview[1,c("Response.count")]` cases. As it turns out, since our labor force question served as a "screener", we were only charged for complete questions, i.e., responses that had completed both Q1 and Q2 of which we had obtained `r xls_overview[2,c("Response.count")]`. Thus, the final response was

```{r responses,results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(xls_overview[,c("Question.text","Response.count")])
```

From this, we can compute a few statistics of interest. 
```{r cps_stats}
results <- data.frame(c(0,0,0),row.names = c("Employment-Population Rate","Unemployment rate","OLF rate"))
results[,1:2] <- 0
names(results) <- c("Google","BLS")
# define OLF, pop, unemployed, employed
pop <- xls_overview[1,c("Response.count")]
nonemp <- xls_overview[2,c("Response.count")]
employed <- pop - nonemp
olfind <- xls_data$Question..2.Answer=="0 (I am not looking for work)"
olf <- nrow(xls_data[olfind,])
google.dates <- c(
  min(as.POSIXct(strptime(xls_data[,"Time..UTC."],"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),tz="UTC")),
  max(as.POSIXct(strptime(xls_data[,"Time..UTC."],"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),tz="UTC"))
  )
# now compute stats
results["Employment-Population Rate",1] <- 
  round(employed*100/pop,2)
results["Unemployment rate",1] <- 
  round((nonemp-olf)*100/employed,2)
results["OLF rate",1] <- 
  round(olf*100/pop,2)
```
which we measured between `r google.dates[1]` and `r google.dates[2]`.

For comparison purposes, we obtained the BLS unemployment rate and employment-population ratio from FRED:
```{r get_fred, cache=TRUE}
# define the series of interest
fred_unemployment <- c("UNRATENSA")
fred_unemployment20 <- c("LNU04000024")
fred_emppop_all   <- c("LNU02300000")
fred_emppop_men   <- c("LNU02300001")
fred_emppop_women <- c("LNU02300002")
fred_olf_count    <- c("LNU05000000")
fred_pop_count    <- c("CNP16OV")

#bls.urate <- get(getSymbols(fred_unemployment,src='FRED'))
bls.urate20 <- get(getSymbols(fred_unemployment20,src='FRED'))
bls.emppop_all <- get(getSymbols(fred_emppop_all,src='FRED'))
#bls.emppop_men <- get(getSymbols(fred_emppop_men,src='FRED'))
#bls.emppop_women <- get(getSymbols(fred_emppop_women,src='FRED'))
#
# Compute the OLF rate
cnt.olf <- get(getSymbols(fred_olf_count,src='FRED'))
cnt.pop <- get(getSymbols(fred_pop_count,src='FRED'))
bls.olf_rate <- cnt.olf*100/cnt.pop
#
# attach the closest value - this might change over time, but that's fine.
# found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8186960/finding-the-most-recent-observation-earlier-than-a-certain-timestamp-with-xts
# For emppop ratio, use all - we will break it out by gender later
results["Employment-Population Rate",2] <- 
  round(bls.emppop_all[findInterval(google.dates[1],index(bls.emppop_all)),]
,2)
results["Unemployment rate",2] <- 
  round(bls.urate20[findInterval(google.dates[1],index(bls.urate20)),],2)
results["OLF rate",2] <- 
  round(bls.olf_rate[findInterval(google.dates[1],index(bls.olf_rate)),],2)

```

The final (unweighted) result is then as follows (note: the BLS numbers won't add up quite to 100, since they stem from different series):

```{r print_stats, results='asis',echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(results)
```
